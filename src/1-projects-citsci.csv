The UKEOF community provided significant input into the development of the original UKEOF catalogue specification, making sure that it would meet the needs of the environmental monitoring community. When the INSPIRE EF specification was being developed the UKEOF community, through the Data Advisory Group, were heavily involved in the consultation.
